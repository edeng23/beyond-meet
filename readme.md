## Setup
### Setting Up Your Google Cloud Project and Activating the Gmail API
Navigate to the Google Developers Console.
Initiate a new project by selecting the "Create Project" option.
Once your project is set up, head over to the "Library" section. Use the search function to locate the "Gmail API" and proceed to enable it for your newly created project.
After enabling the Gmail API, go to the "Credentials" tab. Here, you'll need to generate credentials specifically for an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Follow the prompts to create these credentials.
Upon successful creation, you'll have the option to download a JSON file. This file is crucial as it houses your client configuration details. Save it at the root of the directory.
